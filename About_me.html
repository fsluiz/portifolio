								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p align="justify">I'm a scientist with a passion for data analysis, programming, statistics, and quantum mechanics. Over the course of my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects that have allowed me to develop advanced knowledge in mathematics, statistics, physics, programming, and data analysis.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Some specific examples of my work include:<br>
                                    <ul >
                                        <li> An extensive analysis of quantum states, known as coherent states, which led to the discovery of sets of states that increased the fidelity of the quantum teleportation protocol.</li>
                                        <li>The insight to use these sets as an alphabet for the creation of a quantum encryption protocol.</li>
                                        <li>Analysis of parameters in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that led to the insight that changing this parameter takes the quantum thermodynamic system from cooler to engine.</li>
                                        <li> Building a machine learning algorithm based on lasso algorithm to predict the revenue of each establishment in a fast-food chain network by analyzing sales data together with location and weather data during the brief existence of a startup.</li>
                                    </ui>
                                    <br>
                                    Throughout these projects, I followed a consistent approach to data analysis:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Problem definition: identifying the questions we wanted to answer. </ui>
                                        <li>Data collection: in many cases, we created mathematical models to generate synthetic data when experimental data was not available or insufficient.
                                        <li>Data cleaning: checking for numerical errors, empty spaces, or duplicate data and ensuring that the data made sense.
                                        <li>Data analysis: checking for correlations between observables, answering the questions asked by the data, and gaining new insights.
                                        <li>Prediction: using mathematical models developed through data analysis to predict the behavior of the system. </ui>
                                        <li>Sharing results: publishing results in internationally indexed journals in several cases. </li>
                                    </ui>
                                    I believe that data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and quantum machine learning offer vast opportunities for technology development. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and traveling to new places, which often provide inspiration for my work.</p>
