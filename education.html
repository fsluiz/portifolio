								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p align="justify">I have a solid academic background in physics and mathematics, with a degree in the area and specializations in theoretical physics, with a master's degree in quantum computing and a doctorate in quantum information theory. During my Ph.D., I designed a teleportation protocol, demonstrating my ability to apply my theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics  <br> 2010 - 2014</h3>
                                        <p>Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the Physics Department of the Federal 
											University of São Carlos.</p>

                                       <h3></h3>
                                       <p align="justify"> During my Ph.D., I studied one of the most surprising applications of quantum mechanics
										 that completely escape our common sense: quantum teleportation in continuous variables. Based on data analysis 
										 of coherent states, we propose modifications in its construction to improve the efficiency of the teleportation 
										 protocol. These modifications were made in order to take into account the realistic situations found in the 
										 implementation of the protocol, that is, the fact that the entanglement, between Alice and Bob, is never perfect
										  and the fact that the states teleported by Alice are close to the vacuum state. After this analysis, we 
										  performed an extension of the teleportation protocol proposing a multichannel protocol and studied the case 
										  of two channels in parallel. Finally, we created the first quantum cryptography protocol that actively uses 
										  continuous variable teleportation. We show that this protocol is robust to the beamsplitter attack and is the
										   only one that works with direct reconciliation and without post-selection in the 50% loss scenario.</p>

                                       <h3 class="major"> Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics.<br> 2008 - 2010</h3>
                                       <p>Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics from the Federal University of Uberlândia.</p>
                                       <h3></h3>
                                       
                                       <p align="justify">During my master's degree, I performed the analysis of a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms in two hyperfine levels coupled by a two-photon transition. Analysis of the dynamics data of this system showed that control over the coupling of the condensate allows the creation of a set of universal quantum logic gates, which are the fundamental ingredient for quantum computing. Showing the viability of the Bose-Einstein condensate as a physical system for quantum computing.</p>
