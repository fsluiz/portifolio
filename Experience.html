                                        <h4>Faculdade de Ciências - Universidade Estadual Paulista</h4>
                                       <p align="justify"> During my time at Unesp, I carried out several projects, two main ones being quantum phase
                                         prediction using low-dimensional spin systems and extracting information about the temperature in a quantum 
                                         system using a probe. 
                                         <ul>
                                            <li>In the first project, we wanted to answer the question of whether it was possible to predict 
                                            the phase diagram of a spins-1 quantum system, having knowledge about the phase diagram of other systems. The 
                                            first step was to obtain the data, for this we simulated three spin-1 systems and calculated the two-body 
                                            correlation, thus obtaining the synthetic data. The feature data analysis showed a correlation with the quantum
                                            phases of these systems. This enabled the use of supervised learning algorithms to predict the quantum phase, 
                                            and consequently the phase diagram, measuring the correlations of two bodies.</li>
                                            <li>In the second project, we simulate quantum systems of many bodies in thermalized states, thus obtaining synthetic data, with the 
                                            objective of extracting information about the temperature of the system through the measurement of the 
                                            observable of a probe. Where our database was fed with the observables of this probe. When performing 
                                            statistical analyzes on these data, we noticed that there was a maximum limit of information about the 
                                            temperature that could be obtained through this observable given by Fisher's information. Applying supervised 
                                            learning algorithms, we were able to extract the system temperature with the maximum accuracy allowed.</li>

                                       <p>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics ensure that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians invariant by spatial reflection and time
                                         reversal (symmetric PT) present a real spectrum and unitary evolution as long as a new metric is associated with
                                          them. The introduction and study of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians considerably widen the scope of traditional 
                                          quantum mechanics and enable the occurrence of new phenomena, such as PT symmetry breaking. In our project, we 
                                          focus on uniting the study of fundamentals of physics with the study of possible applications for such
